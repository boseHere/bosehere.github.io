My name is Maya Bose. I am a Graduate Student Research Assistant in the Gilbert S. Omenn Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan. I work in the lab of Stephen Parker.

My research as a member of the Parker lab has focused on using single-nucleus multiomics (RNAseq and ATACseq) to identify how genetic variations, especially in the non-coding regions of the genome, result in complex metabolic and cardiovascular diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes and Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF).

My work has been funded by the NHGRI Genome Sciences Training Program T32
